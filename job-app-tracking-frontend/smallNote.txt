For the registration of the user the user will provide the username, legitimate email with verification with a number sent to the email,
country and district/state or whatever.

The country and district/state or whatever will allow the admin to see where most users are from and this will provide some insights on what
kind of ads will be shown in their page and also provide data on people from which places are applying for specific jobs or companies as well.
